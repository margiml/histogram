# Character frequency histogram

The program counts how often each letter appears in a text file.

the program must:

- Ask the user for the name of the input file.
- Read the file and count all the letters (upper and lower case letters are treated as the same).
- Print an alphabetically ordered histogram on the screen.

The **sampletext.txt** input file must be located in the same directory where the Jupyter notebook is located

The character frequency histogram will be saved in an output file ordered according to the frequency of the characters, that is, the character that appears most frequently first.
The file will have the same name as the input file but with the **.hist** extension

For example, if the file contains a line with: abCc
The result will be seen as follows:

 c -> 2
 
 a -> 1
 
 b -> 1

The output file **sampletext.hist** is generated in the same directory where the jupyter notebook and sampletext.txt are located
